# PortKiller

Don't you just hate it when some web development frameworks tell you that the default port is being used by another process and you need to go through the hoops of finding the guilty process and killing it? Or, it just messes with you by changing the port every single time you start the framework?

Now, this is a very shitty code that I wrote without doing any thorough research, so, use it at your own risk.

Usage:
```bash
$ chmod +x killport.sh
$ ./killport.sh
```
